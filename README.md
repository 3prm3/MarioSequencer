Original software for Windows 95 by Anonymous in 2ch:

How to use
------
Try this link:
http://minghai.github.io/MarioSequencer/

I recommend you to download whole files to local.
This downloads many sounds and images.
You can use this soft without internet after download them all.

Basically, What you see is what you get.

This version lacks Eraser and Undo implementation.
But you can delete a note by right click.
Watch out, no Undo. Save many times.

You can see download button in the bottom of screen.
When you push it, you can save the score as a json file.

After saving it, drag and drop that file into the game screen's score.
Then you can get back to compose.

This web app supports both JSON score files and MSQ files for Mario Sequencer for Windows.
Just drag and drop MSQ files, they will be concatinated, and you can save it as one JSON file.
(Do you know Mario Composer file format? Or can you contribute that for me? :-)

If you want to change the tempo in the middle of the music, separate files,
drag and drop all, then player will change the tempo automatically.

You can use # and b for semitones. Just push Shift and Ctrl key while you left click.
